			<p>
				Prior to this, I was a former Veterinary Technician who studied Veterinary Bioscience for 3 years in a
				local polytechnic and completely transitioned over to this industry as I've always had an interest in
				computers, software, etc. During my National Service, I picked up my skills from online learning
				resources such as online courses and documentations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, I'm searching for a chance to expand my on-the-job experiences and improving my skill set for
				further refinement. Despite my inexperience in this industry, I look forward to continuing my journey in
				the software development industry, meeting new people and gathering more knowledge along the way, and
				eventually putting my skills to use in a professional environment as a full stack web developer.
